I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Universit√© Paris Dauphine ‚Äì PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/), working at the intersection of **macroeconomics**, **artificial intelligence**, and **digital regulation**. My research focuses on how data and compute reshape productivity, emissions, and labor markets in the digital economy using macroeconomic models and computational methods (LLMs, Machine Learning). I am supervised by [Prof. Lise Patureau](https://sites.google.com/view/lisepatureau/home?authuser=0).

Before starting my PhD I was an Economist/Data Scientist at the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en.html) Science, Technology and Innovation Directorate and at the Statistics and Data Directorate. There I applied LLMs to measure digital skills and machine leanrning tools to nowcast trade and productivity indicators.

Outside of research, you find me swimming in some sort of water ([regularly](https://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/paris-75015/paris-la-piscine-keller-quinquagenaire-et-toujours-dans-le-bain-13-03-2017-6758721.php) and [on vacation](https://www.schloesser.bayern.de/deutsch/seen/objekte/ammersee.htm)), hiking in mountains close to the beautiful [Kloster Andechs in the Bavarian Alps](https://www.andechs.de/), or cooking my favourite [Thai green curry](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/green-curry-new-2/).

My thesis explores three main questions:

---

### üìà Chapter 1: Finance & AI

**How do financial frictions affect AI and Big Data investment in Europe ‚Äî and what does this mean for productivity growth?**

Using firm-level survey and balance sheet data (EIBIS and Orbis), I examine the role of intangible capital and constrained investment in slowing down digital adoption. I complement this analysis with a DSGE model featuring financial frictions and non-collateralizable data assets.

---

### üåç Chapter 2: Compute & Climate

**What are the environmental costs of AI ‚Äî and how should climate policy account for emissions from compute infrastructure?**

I build a multi-sector DSGE model linking monopolistic data centers and downstream digital firms. The model captures emissions from compute, unpriced data provision, and regulatory distortions simulating trade-offs between carbon taxes, data policy, and AI-driven productivity.

### üß† Chapter 3: AI/Data & Labor

**How do large language models and AI adoption reshape skill demand and wage inequality?**

I use matched job posting and firm data to analyze how shifts in AI architecture and data access affect labor market outcomes. This work integrates natural language processing and macro modeling to trace the distributional consequences of generative AI and regulatory change.
