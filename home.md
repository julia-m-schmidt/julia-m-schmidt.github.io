I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Université Paris Dauphine – PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/), working at the intersection of **macroeconomics**, **artificial intelligence**, and **digital regulation**. My research focuses on how data and compute reshape productivity, emissions, and labor markets in the digital economy using macroeconomic models and computational methods (LLMs, Machine Learning). I am supervised by [Prof. Lise Patureau](https://sites.google.com/view/lisepatureau/home?authuser=0).

Before starting my PhD, I was an Economist/Data Scientist at the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en.html) Science, Technology and Innovation Directorate and at the Statistics and Data Directorate. There I applied NLP to measure digital skills and machine learning tools to nowcast trade and productivity indicators. I also led a team to design and implement the OECD AI Index, including database creation, data collection and strategic analysis. I have experience managing international projects in collaboration with governments, industry partners and NGOs.

Outside of research and policy work, you find me swimming in some sort of water ([regularly](https://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/paris-75015/paris-la-piscine-keller-quinquagenaire-et-toujours-dans-le-bain-13-03-2017-6758721.php) and [on vacation](https://www.schloesser.bayern.de/deutsch/seen/objekte/ammersee.htm)), hiking in mountains close to the beautiful [Kloster Andechs in the Bavarian Alps](https://www.andechs.de/), or cooking my favourite [Thai green curry](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/green-curry-new-2/).
