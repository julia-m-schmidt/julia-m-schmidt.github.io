## ðŸŽ“ Mentoring & Learning Programs

I am passionate about supporting learners and professionals at different stages of their journey. Below are the current and past mentoring initiatives:

---

### ðŸŒ± [Environmental Education for German Students (Weltfairsteher)](https://www.weltfairsteher.de)

As Strategy Manager and co-lead of the initiative, I worked with a team of 10 volunteers supported by funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Together, we secured â‚¬20,000 per year and raised a total of â‚¬80,000. We reached over 8,000 students across Germany, integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into school curricula. Additionally, we delivered certified teacher trainings nationwide to equip educators with tools for sustainability education.
