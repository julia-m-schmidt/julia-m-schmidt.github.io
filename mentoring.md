## 🎓 Mentoring & Learning Programs

I am passionate about supporting learners and professionals at different stages of their journey. Below are the current and past mentoring initiatives:


### 🌟 Leadership Circle *(Coming Soon)*

A leadership circle that turns early‑career talent from non-elite backgrounds into adventurous, empathetic leaders, through immersive soft‑skill sprints, 1‑to‑1 coaching, and a pan European network built for non‑linear careers. 

The Leadership Circle will help participants:

- Discover hidden-curriculum skills (leadership, negotiation, recognizing biases)
- Build confidence in navigating complex work environments
- Connect with a supportive, cross-disciplinary network

**Stay tuned for more details.**

### 🏛️ [German National Academic Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/) 

I am an almuna of the German National Academic Foundation and regularly participate in its selection committees. If you have been an intern/consultant of mine or a student in one of my courses, I am happy to discuss proposing you for a scholarship. I am generally happy to provide information about student and doctoral fellowships.

### 🌱 [Environmental Education for German Students (Weltfairsteher)](https://www.weltfairsteher.de)

As Strategy Manager and co-lead of the initiative, I worked with a team of 10 volunteers supported by funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Together, we secured €20,000 per year and raised a total of €80,000. We reached over 8,000 students across Germany, integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into school curricula. Additionally, we delivered certified teacher trainings nationwide to equip educators with tools for sustainability education.

### 💻 Mentoring for R and Python at the OECD (2022–2024)

During my time at the OECD, I organised two internal mentoring programs spanning six months each, matching experienced coders with beginners to foster peer learning and reverse traditional hierarchies. I also led the design and delivery of collaborative events—including a Hackathon and a Statistics Day, to build community and showcase innovative data work. In addition, I briefed the Secretary-General and the Chief Statistician on the organisation’s infrastructure and big data needs, contributing to strategic discussions about future capabilities.
