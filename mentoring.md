## ðŸŽ“ Mentoring & Learning Programs

I am passionate about supporting learners and professionals at different stages of their journey. Below are the current and past mentoring initiatives:

---

### ðŸŒ± [Environmental Education for German Students (Weltfairsteher)](https://www.weltfairsteher.de)

As Strategy Manager and co-lead of the initiative, I worked with a team of 10 volunteers supported by funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Together, we secured â‚¬20,000 per year and raised a total of â‚¬80,000. We reached over 8,000 students across Germany, integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into school curricula. Additionally, we delivered certified teacher trainings nationwide to equip educators with tools for sustainability education.

### ðŸ’» Mentoring for R and Python at the OECD (2022â€“2024)

During my time at the OECD, I organised two internal mentoring programs spanning six months each, matching experienced coders with beginners to foster peer learning and reverse traditional hierarchies. I also led the design and delivery of collaborative eventsâ€”including a Hackathon and a Statistics Day, to build community and showcase innovative data work. In addition, I briefed the Secretary-General and the Chief Statistician on the organisationâ€™s infrastructure and big data needs, contributing to strategic discussions about future capabilities.

- Discover hidden-curriculum skills (leadership, negotiation, recognizing biases)
- Build confidence in navigating complex work environments
