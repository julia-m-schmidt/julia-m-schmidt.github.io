I am currently a PhD Candidate at Universit√© Paris Dauphine - PSL, supervised by Prof. Lise Patureau. My research interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomics and digital economics. I use general equilibrium models, Bayesian estimation and machine learning to better understand how the data economy works. 

Questions that I care about currently are:
- How can data assets, non-rival experience goods, be modelled in classic economic frameworks? How do they differ from other assets and what is their value?
- What happens after a technology shock to wage inequality in an economy that relies heavily on data assets?
- Which patterns of firm productivity and trade behaviour can we observe in a data-intensive economy? 

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist/Economist at the Science, Technology and Innovation Directorate as well as the Statstics and Data Directorate of the OECD. 

In my free time, you find me hiking in the mountains or swimming in some sort of water. Explore my research, work experience, teaching, and feel free to reach out if you want to have a chat.
