### **The Missing Productivity Edge ‚Äì Access to Finance and Europe‚Äôs AI Challenge**  
*Coauthored with Lise Patureau and Fabien Tripier*  
This paper examines whether financial frictions limit firms‚Äô ability to invest in and adopt AI and Big Data technologies, contributing to Europe‚Äôs productivity gap. Using matched firm-level data from Orbis and the EIBIS survey, we assess how finance constraints affect intangible investment in AI and data. We then build a macro model with financial frictions (√† la Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997), featuring two capital types‚Äîtangible (collateralizable) and intangible (non-collateralizable)‚Äîand introduce a novel channel through which data, as a specific intangible asset, shapes productivity growth.

### **The Environmental Cost of Free Data: Emissions, AI and a Missing Market**  
*by Julia M. Schmidt*  
This paper studies how climate constraints interact with the data economy, where compute-intensive AI services raise productivity but concentrate emissions upstream. We build a multi-sector general equilibrium model in which one sector produces AI services using data and compute, while the other produces a traditional good. Inspired by Jones and Tonetti (2020) and Farboodi and Veldkamp (2021), we model data as a productivity-enhancing input and add an emissions externality tied to compute. We evaluate policy instruments such as carbon taxes and data pricing, highlighting how mispriced compute leads to overadoption of AI relative to its marginal productivity. Stylized facts on data center energy use and AI efficiency gains complement the theoretical framework.
